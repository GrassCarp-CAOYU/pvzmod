It has been several days, why is 
there still no zombie?
It maybe because the wisdom-tree 
in your body hides your breath,but
this is not permanent protection. 
3 days later,This protection will 
disappear,and overworld will have 
a certain probability of being 
invaded by zombies!
Zombie invasion is called an event,
and the type of event determines
Type and number of zombies invaded.
